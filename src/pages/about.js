        Greetings!

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Bruce. I'm a second year computer science student at

        Who I Am
      </h1>
        <p>
          I'm an incoming technical intern at DXC
          Technology in New Orleans for summer 2022 and a member of 
          the SciQuel web development team.

        Some Fun Facts
      </h1>
        <p>
          I really like listening to K-Pop and watching anime and K-Dramas.
          My favorite anime right now are probably Bleach, Black Clover,
          and Bungo Stray Dogs. I'm always willing to watch and listen to
          new things!
        </p>

        Why I Made This Website
      </h1>
        <p>
          This website is one of my first real solo web development
          projects that I'm developing, and I hope to use it as 
          a personal website. Please see "Contact" info to get in
          touch, as I'm always willing to work with new people and
          learn more about software and web development and other
          subjects!
